# KiCAD component library

This repository poses as a central storage for KiCAD library files.

## Using this library

Use this repository as a git submodule in your project. This ensures that the relative paths to the files stay the same.

## Where to find components

* `passive/` for resistors, capacitors, inductors and filters
* `semi/` for ICs, diodes, LEDs, transistors and crystals
    * `ICs/` are sorted by manufacturer
* `mechanical` for connectors
